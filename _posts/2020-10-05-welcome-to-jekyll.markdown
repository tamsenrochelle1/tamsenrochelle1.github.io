I am born and raised in Utah, I love the landscape but hate the cold. With COVID-19 this year I am going to finally try skiing otherwise there are no real outdoor activities in Winter. I'm terrified of spiders but respect them and their place in the world. I love snails. This website is very much a work in progress, but I love how far it has come already!
